Integral matrices: Hermite, Smith normal forms and lattice functions 

This  package  provides  the  Smith  and  Hermite normal forms for integral
matrices,  the Diaconis-Graham  normal form  for sets  of generators  of an
abelian  group,  and  a  few  functions to  work  with integral matrices as
lattices.
